## Overview

For the latest pricing and plans, visit our [pricing page](https://tapify.app/pricing). Tapify's subscription model is straightforward: it's based on the number of team members in your workspace.&#x20;

We use a pro-rated billing system, so you only pay for what you use. Your charges are calculated accordingly each billing cycle.

Billing is available on a **monthly** or **annual** basis.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Monthly">
    Billing is based on the current number of team members in your workspace. Adding or removing members mid-cycle is billed pro-rata, added team members are charged on the next invoice, while removed members receive a credit.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Annually">
    We charge your account annually based on the number of active users in your workspace at the time of purchase.

    If you add or delete team members during the subscription year, we will apply a pro-rated charge or credit for the remaining term. Credits are applied to future invoices but are not refundable.
