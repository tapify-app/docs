## Overview

Permissions in Tapify are configured at the workspace level and determine how team members receive/access their digital business card. You can choose between two permission settings, which can be managed under [Settings > Permissions](https://tapify.app/settings/permissions).

## Invite to download

This option allows you to invite team members to add their digital business card to Apple Wallet or Google Wallet. They will receive an email with a direct link to download and save their card.

## Full access

Full access gives team members control over their contact details and sharing options while keeping admin controls in place. With Full Access, team members can:

* Download their Apple- or Google Wallet Business Card.

* Update their Tapify profile (e.g., contact details, profile photo).

* View personally made contacts and analytics.

#### Locks

Administrators can lock specific fields, such as profile photo or contact details, to ensure consistency across all team profiles. Team members can still access their accounts but wonâ€™t be able to edit locked fields.
