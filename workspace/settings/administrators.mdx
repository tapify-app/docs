## Overview

Administrators have full access to the workspace, allowing them to manage team members, branding, and settings. Only administrators can access the workspace.

## Add an administrator

To add administrators to your workspace:

1. Go to [Settings > Administrators](https://tapify.app/settings/administrators)***.***

2. Here, you can view a list of all current administrators.

3. Click ***Add administrator*** and select a team member you want to add as an administrator.

<Note>
  To add a new administrator, ensure that this person is already a team member.
</Note>

## Unlink as administrator

When you unlink an admin from the workspace, their admin rights are revoked. They will remain a team member but will no longer have access to the workspace.

To unlink an administrator:

1. Go to [Settings > Administrators](https://tapify.app/settings/administrators)***.***

2. Locate the administrator you want to unlink.

3. Click **Unlink**.

<Note>
  If a team member with admin rights is deleted from the workspace, they will automatically lose their administrator privileges.&#x20;
