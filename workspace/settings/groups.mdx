## Overview

Groups in Tapify help organize team members by department, location, or other categories. Ideal for large companies or multi-office teams. They simplify management, filtering, and allow customized branding per group.

## Create a group

1. Go to your workspace's Settings > Groups.

2. Click on **Create a group** at the top right of this page.

3. Name your group and click on **Create**.

Your group is now created. You can assign it to a specific template — [learn more](https://docs.tapify.app/workspace/templates/profile#assign-a-group).

## Assign team members to a group

1. Go to your workspace's [Team Management](https://tapify.app/).

2. Click on the three dots next to the team member you want to assign.

3. Select **Settings**.

4. Select a group from the dropdown.

5. Click on **Save**.

Now, this team member has been successfully assigned to this group.

## Deleting a group

1. Go to [Settings > Groups](https://tapify.app/settings/groups).

2. Click **Delete** next to the group.

When you delete a group, assigned team members automatically don't belong to any group anymore.
