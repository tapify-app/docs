### QR codes

We provide the final QR codes on the Tapify NFC Card(s). You only need to indicate where we should place it. This can be done through:

* An example QR code (including desired colors if needed).

* A white box in where the QR code must be placed.

### File requirements

Please export your files in **PDF without printmarks** (cropmarks and others).
