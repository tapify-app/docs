## Overview

Tapify Profile Templates helps you maintain consistency across your team’s Tapify Profiles by applying company branding, contact details, and social links automatically. This keeps all team members’ profiles unified and professional.

## Configure

### Default Template

Each workspace includes a **Default Template**, which applies to all team members, ensuring their profiles align with your company’s branding and contact details.

To set up your Tapify Profile template:

1. Go to your workspace’s [Templates](https://tapify.app/templates)[ > ](https://tapify.app/templates)[Tapify Profile](https://tapify.app/templates).

2. Add company details that will automatically appear on each team member’s profile.

3. Set the order in which contact details appear on the Tapify Profile.

### Branding

Align Tapify Profile Template with your company’s branding by customizing these options:

* **Theme**: Select dark or light mode.

* **Style**: Adjust the roundness of the profile picture, icons, and buttons.

* **Font**: Choose a font that matches your brand.

* **Brand color**: Set the color for icons and buttons.

* **Banner**: Upload a banner image that represents your company.

  * *Recommended size: 1080 x 675px, or a 8:5 ratio*

### Company information

Add company details that will automatically appear on each team member’s profile, eliminating the need to enter the same contact information repeatedly (e.g., website link, general email).

<Warning>
  Only add company contact details here — personal contact details should be added in Team management separately.
</Warning>

### Settings

Use the “Data Order” setting to choose whether personal or company information appears first on the profile.
