## Overview

Tapify Profile Templates helps you maintain consistency across your team’s Tapify Profiles by applying company branding, contact details, and social links automatically. This keeps all team members’ profiles unified and professional.

## Configure Tapify Profile template

2. Add company details that will automatically appear on each team member’s profile.

3. Set the order in which contact details appear on the Tapify Profile.

* **Theme**: Select dark or light mode.

* **Style**: Adjust the roundness of the profile picture, icons, and buttons.
