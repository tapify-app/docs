## Add an administrator

To add administrators to your Tapify Workspace, follow these simple steps:

1. Navigate to ***Settings > Administrators.***

2. Here, you can view a list with the current administrators.

3. To add a new administrator, ensure that this person is already added as a user.

4. Click on ***Add administrator*** and select a user you want to add as an administrator.

## Unlink as administrator

You can also unlink a user as an administrator, but please note that this action won't delete them as a user from your Tapify Workspace. When you unlink a user as an administrator, they will no longer have the rights to access Tapify Workspace.
