## What is a Tapify Profile Template?

Tapify Profile Templates help you maintain consistency across your team’s Tapify Profiles. By adding branding, company contact details, and social links once, you can ensure all team members’ profiles look unified and professional.

## How do Templates work?

### Default Template

Every Tapify Workspace includes a default template called **Default Template.** This template automatically applies to all users in your workspace, keeping everyone’s profiles consistent with your company’s branding and contact details.

### Creating Templates

If your company has for example different locations or departments that require unique contact details, branding, or social links, you can create additional templates to cater to these needs. Here’s how it works:

1. Navigate to workspace's [Templates](https://tapify.app/).

2. Click on **Create Template** at the top right of this page.

3. Name your Template and click on **Save**.

4. Click on the Template to customize it to your needs.

Use the [Teams feature](https://tapify.io/teams) to assign specific templates to groups of users. This way, you can apply different templates for different teams, locations, or departments.

## Configure a Template

When you select a template, you can configure it by adding branding, company information, and setting preferences. A live preview will show your changes, so you can see how it looks before publishing.

### Branding

Align Tapify Profile Template with your company’s branding by customizing these options:

* **Theme**: Select dark or light mode.

* **Style**: Adjust the roundness of the profile picture, icons, and buttons.

* **Font**: Choose a font that matches your brand.

* **Brand color**: Set the color for icons and buttons.

* **Banner**: Upload a banner image that represents your company.

### Company information

Add essential company details like your company name, general email, website link, address, and social media links (e.g., LinkedIn). Personal details must be added in the Profile settings of the user.

### Settings

Use the “Data Order” setting to choose whether personal or company information appears first on the profile.

## Publish

When your Tapify Profile Template is ready for your team, click `Publish`. From then on, all users assigned to this Template will see their profiles instantly updated with any changes you make.
