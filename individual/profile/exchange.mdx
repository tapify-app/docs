## Overview

The Exchange contact details feature allows for a seamless two-way contact exchange. When you meet someone, they can fill out a built-in lead capture form to share their details with you.

## How it works

1. The person you meet opens the **lead capture form** on your Tapify Profile.

2. They enter their **name, email, phone number, and any other relevant details**.

3. Once submitted:

   * Their contact details are sent to your **email**, including a **VCF file** for instant saving.

   * The contact is automatically **s**aved in your Tapify account under **Contacts**.
