## Overview

In Tapify, Teams make it easy to organize users by departments, locations, or other groups. This feature is perfect for large companies or those with multiple offices, simplifying the management and filtering of digital business cards. Teams also allow you to customize company information and branding for each Team.

## Setup Teams

### Create a Team

1. Navigate to your workspace's ***Settings > Teams***.

2. Click on `Create a Team` at the top right of this page.

3. Name your Team and click on `Create`.

4. Now your Team has been created successfully.

### Assign users to a Team

1. Navigate to your workspace's ***User management***.

2. Click on the three dots next to the user you want to assign.

3. Click `Settings`.

4. Select a Team from the dropdown.

5. Click on `Save`.

6. Now, this user has been successfully assigned to this Team.

### Deleting a team

To delete a team, go to your workspace’s ***Settings > Teams*** and click `Delete`. The team will be removed, but the users in it won’t be deleted—they’ll simply no longer belong to any team.

## How Teams work with Templates

You can assign a Team to a specific [Tapify Profile Template](https://tapify.io/help/article/tapify-profile-template), allowing you to display different company information and branding for users in that Team. Here’s how to do it:

2. Click on the three dots next to the Template you want to assign your Team to.

3. Click `Assign Team`.
