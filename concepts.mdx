## Tapify Profile

A Tapify Profile serves as your digital business card — an all-in-one page that includes essential contact details, social media links, and personal information such as your profile photo. Any changes you make to your Tapify Profile are automatically updated, ensuring you never share outdated information.

Your profile includes two key buttons to make sharing and exchanging contact details seamless:

* **Save Contact** – Instantly saves your contact details to the phone of the person you meet.

* **Exchange** – Opens a built-in lead capture form that the recipient can fill out. Once submitted, a new contact is automatically created in your Tapify account.

## Workspace

A Tapify workspace is a centralized environment for creating, managing, and distributing digital business cards across your team or organization. It ensures brand consistency, simplifies team management, and gives full control over how digital business cards are designed and shared.

## Team members

A team member is an employee or colleague added to your workspace who receives access to a digital business card. You can update their contact details, personal information, and social links anytime.

Each team member automatically gets a Tapify Profile, where all their details are displayed. Once set up, their Apple Wallet Business Card and Google Wallet Business Card are instantly generated. Simply send an invite, and they’re ready to start using their digital business card.

## Contacts

Contacts in Tapify represent the people you’ve exchanged details with using the **Exchange** feature on your Tapify Profile. Contacts help you keep track of new connections, making it easy to follow up and stay connected after meetings, events, or networking sessions.

## Templates

Templates in Tapify help maintain a consistent and professional look across all digital business cards in your workspace. They define branding, contact details, and design elements in advance, ensuring that every team member’s Tapify Profile, Apple Wallet Business Card, and Google Wallet Business Card align with your company’s identity.

## Groups

**Groups** in Tapify help organize team members within a workspace, making it easier to manage digital business cards at scale. Groups can be used to categorize team members by department, role, location, or other criteria, ensuring that branding and templates are applied consistently.
